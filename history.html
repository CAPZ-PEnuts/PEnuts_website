                                But it wasn't that easy. Indeed, the project groups weren't created easily. Each student had to think with who he wanted to be for a complete year working on a project... <br>
                                
                                The creation of the group was done really fast. Indeed, we are all good in programming, we are all motivated and each one of us had something to add to a project like that. <br> <br>

                                At the beginning we had such a lot of ideas - even to much - that we often said "faut pas partir en couilles..." (meaning in English : We can't go in all directions at the same time). <br>
                                In this way, we found it funny to name our game with something like that. <br>
                                Indeed PE are for "Partir En" and nuts stand for "couilles".Then both placed together gave penuts which is - as you may have noticed - not that far from peanuts. <br> <br>
                                Finding it so funny and describing so much our way of thinking that it became our game's name.

                                What really described us was already used in the game's name, so we did not go far.<br>
                                Indeed, as you can see, our names are :

                                Yes, indeed, as a big part of the groups I think. We came across many difficulties in fact...
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Organisation (hard to organise code). Github is hard to master and unity isn't well made for collaboration. Meaning both combined, it was hard to have two person working on the same thing at the same time.</li>
                                    <li>Difference between unity knowledges (meaning difficulties for tasks distributions). Ziane already had 2 years of unity's experience, for the rest of us it was the first time. This software is so big than if someone start to master something (example : network, music, menus, and so on...) He must learn the other how to do and how it works. But with the time restrictions, it was hard to do so.</li>
                                    <li>Different points of view. Indeed, we did not defined everything in every single details. Meanwhile when it came time to code, we understood that we had exactly the same big points, but not the same details (which where let to our own imaginations). So the result weren't the same and the gameplay was changed depending on each vision. To avoid this difficulty we should have defined everything clearer at the beginning.</li>
                                </ul>
                                Hence, even if it was a hard time, we learned how to organize and work as a group.
